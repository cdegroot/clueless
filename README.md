# Clueless

We have hack days at PagerDuty. Short of wanting to do something with [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org)
I didn't have any ideas, so I went meta and started building a tool to propose and discuss hack days, which
should come in handy if you're clueless about what to do on a hack day. 

Very much WIP.
